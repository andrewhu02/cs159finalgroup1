# Pruning Filters For Efficient ConvNets

INCOMPLETE

#### Absolute sum of filter weights for each layer of VGG-16 trained on CIFARA-10
* This graph was created in [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/tyui592/notepad/blob/master/pruning_filters_for_efficient_convets/prune_filter_for_efficient_convnets.ipynb). You can make the graph yourself.
